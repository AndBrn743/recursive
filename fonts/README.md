# Recursive fonts

The latest release of fonts can be found at https://github.com/arrowtype/recursive/releases.

This folder also contains the latest built font files. It may also include fonts that not included in releases, usually because they are newer betas of work in progress.

The directory `recursive_for_googlefonts` is for use by the Google Fonts font packaging system.
