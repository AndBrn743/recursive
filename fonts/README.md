# Recursive fonts

The latest release of fonts can be found at https://github.com/arrowtype/recursive/releases.

This folder also contains the latest built font files, and font files that may not be included in releases either because they are newer or backups (for instance, there are separate static OTF and TTF font files in case the TrueType Collection and OpenType Collection files don't work for people).
