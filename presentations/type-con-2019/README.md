# TypeCon 2019


## Who am I?

- SD to MN to NY to NL to NY
- graphic design to product design to brand design to type design
- but I love a huge range of design, from hand lettering to UI to web development
- People often caution against being a generalist. They have some good points.
- But I want to do everything! And if not *everything,* I at least want to do a lot of things in a fun way, rather than one thing "perfectly"

## Why Recursive Mono?

- My generalist tendencies led me to my TM thesis. Not display, but not *not* nice to look at. Connects my love of brush scripts to my love of code.
- I love the surge of high-quality monospace fonts that have been released in recent years. Input, Operator, Vulf, SF, Plex
- Developers tend to either:
  - not know what font they use, but have strong opinions anyway
  - know a font and like it a lot (often, this is either Input or Operator – two really excellent fonts)
- when you code, you spend all day with text as a primary interface for your work. Why not make this more useful and more enjoyable?
- People don't necessarily want something that is boring, but they reallly don't want something that is too fun, because that is distracting
- What if a coding font let you choose how fun you wanted it to be? what if this can depend on the context?
- Recursive Mono can! I use Strict in long-form code VS Code, Casual in iTerm, and SemiCasual in Drawbot.

## Why Recursive Sans?

- Most of the best monospace fonts start as sans-serifs. But what if a font went the other direction? 
- Working with helvetica for 2.5 years was a great training as a designer
- I love letters, and might have spent too much time fretting about font selection if I were working as a design (not that this is a bad thing!) As a beginner, it was really valuable to put that time into focusing on the many, many other areas of designing products. Research, collaboration, writing, prototyping, information architecture, code, versioning, email, etc etc.
- Also: I gained a bunch of things that annoyed me about type!
  - "microinteractions" are wonderful. Transitioning colors, sizing, and positioning of interactive elements makes a UI feel so much smoother and nicer to use
  - Type is terrible for this. Want a different style on interaction? Too bad!
  - It'll shift and look janky
  - There's no way(*) to transition font styles nicely
    - typical digital fonts can't transition between separate styles
    - variable fonts are changing this, but even these tend to have "incompatible" styles – their layout changes with different styles
  - Recursive Sans changes this
    - every style can smoothly transition to every other style
    - glyph metrics stay the exact same between all styles. 
    - Casual Heavy Italic = Strict Light = SemiCasual Medium SemiItalic
