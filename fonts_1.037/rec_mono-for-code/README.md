# Rec Mono for Code

These fonts are adapted specifically for use in code editors using themes that combine Regular & Italic styles (such as Night Owl, Monokai, and Atom One Dark Theme).

Due to a bug in macOS (as of Catalina, 10.15.3, but also in previous versions), the full name "Recursive" is treated as an italic font (because it contains the substring "cursive" â€“ [really](https://github.com/arrowtype/recursive/issues/153)). So, these fonts have the abbreviated name "Rec Mono" in order to avoid that issue.

They are also provided as four-style-only families, because some code environments apparently have issues with families containing more than four styles ([according to Input from Font Bureau & DJR](https://input.fontbureau.com/workarounds/)).

To utilize them in a code editor like VS Code, Atom, or Sublime, use the following names:

```
'Rec Mono Casual Static'
```

or 

```
'Rec Mono Linear Static'
```

Did you know you can customize how Recursive (AKA `Rec Mono`) looks in many code editors?
