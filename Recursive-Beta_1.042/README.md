## Recommendations

**General use (Word, PowerPoint, Keynote, InDesign, Illustrator, PhotoShop, Figma, etc)**

- On Windows, install `recursive-statics.ttc` (This is a collection of all 64 static instances in TTF format)
- On Mac, install `recursive-statics.otc` (This is a collection of all 64 static instances in OTF format)

**Code**

- Install fonts in `rec_mono-for-code` (see README in that directory for further advice)

**Web design (Sketch)**

- Install `Recursive_VF_1.042.ttf`

**Web**

- Use the woff2 font files. If you are making a site with a lot of styles, you can save filesize by using the full variable font (which includes the 64 axes, plus all in-between styles). If you only need a style or two, just use static instances.
