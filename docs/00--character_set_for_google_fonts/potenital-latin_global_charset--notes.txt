- overview of GF latin global
- show what percentage recursive already has

Characters to make (approximation, includes required alternates for mono, italic, and sans versions):
- 56 glyphs will need drawing in all 24 masters
- 41 glyphs can probably be drawn in the 12 Mono masters
- 45 glyphs are likely possible to make with components, but may need extra adjustment / decomposing w/ manual edits
- 186 new component glyphs
- 204 existing glyphs to double-check

assumptions: between us, we can do:
- 5 to 10 new Mono glyphs per day in 12 masters
- 3 to 5 new Mono+Sans glyphs per day in 24 masters

And we will need:
- 5 total days to create & possibly refine 231 new component/mostly-component glyphs
- 5 total days for proofing (writing scripts to check completeness, print checks)
- 10 total days for fixing issues

fastest timeline: 
- 56/10 = 5.6 days for mono-only glyphs
- 41/5 = 8.2 days for mono+sans glyphs
- 5 days for new component glyphs
- 15 days proofing + fixing issues

5.6 + 8.2 + 5 + 15 = 33.8 days for both designers (about 7 weeks @ 5 days/week)

slower timeline:
- 56/5 = 11.2 days mono-only
- 41/3 = 13.7 days mono+sans
- 5 days for new component glyphs
- 15 days proofing + fixing

11.2 + 13.7 + 5 + 15 = 44.9 days for both designers (about 9 weeks @ 5 days/week)

Stephen only
- about 5 days for additional mastering, updating website (some will be done during production process)

Lisa 
- Timeline before starting: probably in 2–4 weeks
	- finishing nushu design, starting an article about it

Stephen
	- still working on website

Project timeline: approx. April 15 – June 15

precendents
- currencies: 
	- about 10–20 glyphs per day, between 12 masters (currencies are mostly mono, apart from ₩)
	- then double the time to make them compatible
- vietnamese
	- about 94 extra glyphs, mostly diacritics (https://github.com/googlefonts/gftools/blob/master/Lib/gftools/encodings/vietnamese_unique-glyphs.nam)
	- about 5 days for both Lisa & Stephen
