# Character Set for Google Fonts 

## Glyphs added that are not required

- code ligatures
- diagonal arrows
- more prebuilt fractions

## Not doing

Some glyphs will not be supported by Recursive, because they are not particularly useful in a font for code & UI. 

- Small caps

- Peseta, Lira, Franc
  - outdated

- Lining figures (`.lf` in Plus)
  - All figures are lining

- Traditional "discretionary ligatures"
  - `T_h c_h c_t s_t`
