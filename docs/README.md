# Recursive Project Notes

These are informal notes of work, experiments, and process along the way of making Recursive.

They are not comprehensive, nor carefully written for maximum readability. Rather, they are more of a worklog. 

My hope is that making them public may provide insights to others on the processes and workflows involved in designing & developing a variable font project.

## Notes on notes

To a large extent, I take notes either in Dropbox Paper or in VS Code. There are some useful tools for each.

**Dropbox Paper**

Export to Markdown, to put into VS Code and then GitHub.

Use Chrome Extension [Image Downloader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/image-downloader/cnpniohnfphhjihaiiggeabnkjhpaldj) to also download images to include in notes (by default, Dropbox just points to Dropbox image links).

**VS Code**

[Paste Image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image) makes it easy to paste images directly into markdown files.

Important addition to VS Code settings:

```
    // put images pasted into markdown into an 'assets' folder in the same directory
    "pasteImage.path": "${currentFileDir}/assets",
```

## Web tests

Some of these docs are web tests. I link to these from here:
