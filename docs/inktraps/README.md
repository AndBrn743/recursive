# Inktraps. Yes or no? What size?

Since finishing TypeMedia, I have continued to observe and work with type, and I have become more convinced of a few things: 

- There is value in (slightlyl) increasing the contrast in Recursive â€“ particularly in the Casual styles, but also probably in the Strict styles. Overall, this will give the typeface a bit more "drama." More importantly, on the Casual side it will better connect it to hand-painted casual script, and on the Strict side, it will better connect it to modern, utilitarian type design.
- In this evolution of my thinking, I have also determined that inktraps are an aesthetically valuable part of type. They are a visual signal that a letter is more "finished," and they give a more decisive appearance to negative space.

But how much contrast should there be? And how big should inktraps be?

Do they make a difference at body text size? Yes and no. This is far from a comprehensive, scientific test, but here is a scaled-up screenshot of 14px type, in the RoboFont Space Center on macOS:

The real difference, I think, is when type is larger: around 21px and up:
