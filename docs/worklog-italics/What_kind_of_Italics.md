# What kind of Italics?
I'm starting to wonder whether I should pivot away from the script style in favor of an interpolatable italic, potentially with a few alternate characters that could swap in if people want a true italic... 

On the one hand, several designers have responded really positively to the script. I don't know if the name "recursive" makes as much sense without a running script. 

On the other hand, if I use script shapes for the italic, people will compare it to Operator very quickly. Casual Script is typically slanted, so it would be easy for people to understand a slanted version. I'm having a hard time finding shapes for the simplified version that don't look overly vintage-diner-like. And variable fonts are the new hotness, so that route may be a higher return on my energy. Maaaybe if it allows things to be faster, it could help me go further on weight, flavor, or character sets (though, the last one hardly matters).

But I'm really hesitant to kill another part of the family. :/

I'm also somewhat attached to the name "recursive," and I worry that if there's no running script in the family, the name might not be entirely legitimate

Either way, I think i might have the most success, the fastest, by starting the italics again from copying and skewing the Romans. Otherwise, I'm really not sure I'll have much visual consistency between the styles

After some initial testing ... Yeah, my original idea of a sloped Roman is way more promising than the script I was working on. I'm still a bit stuck on the name, but ... Maybe if people really like this typeface, I could add a true script style in the future

It would also offer the aluring possibility of seeing how much I could generate the italic (with corrections) through scripting.  I was playing with this a little bit, but I've realized that I could possibly label the points to change first, then have a script skew everything and unskew or rotate labeled points, etc



## Script Italic

**Pros**

- It will take a lot of challenging, creative drawing time to figure out the shapes
- Several people have responded quite positively to it

**Cons**

- It will take a lot of challenging, creative drawing time to figure out the shapes
- So far, the stiffer “text” shapes look a bit like a 50’s diner font
- So far, the “heading” styles are probably *too* fluid, in comparison to heading roman
- the cursive shapes in a monospace instantly make people think of Operator. Even if my shapes and overall results are quite different, Operator is such a popular typeface in such a limited genre, it will be difficult or impossible to avoid comparison. 
- It would introduce new, complex ideas to my project, which would require a whole extra set of explanation/justification, and possibly confused my audience. 
- The outlines wouldn’t be compatible with the roman, so it would roughly double the amount of data in an eventual variable font.
## Sloped Roman Italic

**Pros**

- Casual Script is *usually* painted at a slope, so this would better fit the original subject matter and result in a more clear, focused output
- The shapes are immediately obvious – slope the roman, then fix the issues
- Would make it possible to give a “slant” axis in a variable font – particularly compelling in a casual script
- It would provoke fewer comparisons to Operator
- sloping the now-more-complete roman fonts would provide a stronger basis for making the level of detail in the italics match the romans. This would fix the current issue of strong mismatching.
- May allow for some interesting scripting to be done to automate some of the sloping process

**Cons**

- Scrapping the script italic (for now) would mean chopping off another big part of the type family (I’ve decided to also not do blackletter, for now).
- If the only italic is sloped roman, it may have too *similar* of a texture to work well in code syntax highlighting. Part of my goal in this project is to make a typeface that would have a very-obvious italic for code comments.
- If none of my font is actually *cursive* (running, connected script), the name “Recursive” may not be a very good fit anymore. 


## Sloped Roman, plus true italic alternates

**Pros**

- (same pros as sloped roman)
- would be a clear goal, but could also allow for a medium-strong level of texture in italics

**Cons**

- (same cons as sloped roman)
- not yet clear how I would make the italic alternates obvious to users
    - maybe the instances could make true italics default, while the variable font makes them a stylistic set, or (better yet) a `0–1` variable axis?


# Recursive naming?
> **Cursive** (also known as **script**, **longhand** or **joined-up writing**, among other names[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursive#cite_note-1)) is any style of [penmanship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penmanship) in which some characters are written joined together in a flowing manner, generally for the purpose of making writing faster. Formal cursive is generally joined, but casual cursive is a combination of joins and pen lifts. The writing style can be further divided as "looped", "[italic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic_script)" or "connected".
