Recursive is typographic palette for UI & code, drawing inspiration from single-stroke casual signpainting, a style of brush writing that is stylistically flexible and warmly energetic.
</p>
<p>
Adapting this aesthetic basis into an extensive type system, Recursive is designed to excel in digital interactive environments, including data-rich user interfaces, technical documentation, and code editors.
