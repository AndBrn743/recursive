# Recursive - Origins & Process

*Recursive* is an extensive type family for programming & user interface design. It was conceived from the beginning as a variable font family, giving it better compression and far more flexibility than traditional, static digital fonts. Not only are many styles stored within a single font file for better use on the web, but these styles are smoothly interpolatable – allowing more control and new possibilities in typography.

Before going too far in describing what Recursive is, let's take a step back, and look at where it came from, and how it was created.

## Origins: 

Recursive was designed in 2018 by Stephen Nixon as his thesis project at TypeMedia, a 1-year masters program for type design at The Royal Academy of Art (KABK) in the Hague, NL. 

Stephen Nixon is a type designer currently working in NYC. Before TypeMedia, he was a designer at IBM – first as a visual designer for software, then as a brand & web designer in the IBM Watson brand team. During his time designing for products and websites, he gained a love of coding for the web as a way to collaborate with engineering teammates and to prototype & build web experiences.

On the side of working on digital products, Stephen immersed himself in lettering and type design, exploring these disciplines for small freelance projects, murals, and social media posts. In this, he gained a special fondness for rendering brush scripts with ink and beziers. It is a special challenge to make forms work well once they are in a "fixed" state. The human eye can be forgiving when viewing brush strokes, but gets more critical as rendering is simplified to black-and-white letters.

## Why make a casual script?

*Casual caps* are a style of writing from commercial signpainting. They originated in the early 1900s in America, invented by many signpainters as an efficient way to make appealing letters with a minimum amount of brush strokes. The shapes of casual caps are derived from this approach: The strokes of letters are single strokes of a brush, slightly curved and written at a slant to eliminate the need for finishing strokes and touch-ups. 

In signpainting, "casual caps" are often paired with a *casual script* for lowercase text. This script is elegant, inviting, and pairs well with casual caps. However, as a connected script, it is less easy to scan and read than the *Roman* lowercase letters we are all so familiar with in everyday texts from books to street signs.

For his thesis project, Stephen Nixon wondered what an alphabet might look like if it brought the sensibility and recognizability of casual caps into lowercase letters, and how this might be taken further to make fixed-width letters for use in writing code.
