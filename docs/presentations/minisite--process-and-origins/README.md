# Major stages & decisions in recursive

_Written by Stephen Nixon_
_Edited by Noemi Stauffer_

Recursive is a very personal project, but one which I think many people can benefit from.

## Before

- Grew up living letters. Excited to learn graphic design was a career path. Went to school for it. Excited to learn type had a career path, and programs like TypeMedia existed.
- After undergrad, IBM Product/brand designer, lettering/fonts on the side
- I love to code (especially for the web). I love the many fun, warm-hearted resources for people wanting to grow as web developers â€“ resources like CSS Tricks and MDN, tools like CodePen, frameworks like GatsbyJS, and podcasts like Syntax FM, Toolsday, and ShopTalkShow.
- I love making fonts.
- Making websites and making fonts both feel magical to me. Some people find the term "magic" to be dismissive of the thoughtful technical complexity that goes into making these things work, but I'm not being dismissive at all. Rather, both pursuits give me a primordial sense of joy and pride. I get to feel not just "I MADE THIS THING," but also know that these things are digital & interactive, and in that sense, infinite.
- Recursive was a way to combine the things I love.
- I made it in RoboFont, a font editor that is slightly intimidating for newcomers, but really encourages customization of one's workflow with scripts, extensions, and the split-up UFO file format. Throughout the project, I used scripting and coding as a way to automate my workflow, generate versions and proofs of the work-in-progress, and test the font on the web. Whenever possible, I used the latest versions of Recursive Mono for this coding, which helped me to find and note issues to improve. By using the font outputs as a tool to produce the font, I was working recursively â€“ using outputs as inputs to generate an outcome that would have otherwise been impossible.

## Context

- TypeMedia is... (Explain basic legacy of program, plus semester 1 courses)
- TypeMedia is known for producing projects that are experimental, but often very rooted in the idea of type coming from handwritten strokes. Often, projects include styles for both display and text.
- Outsiders tend to think of fonts in a way that is very limited, and largely driven by a "Microsoft Word" categorization of type: one style in "RIBBI"
- Historically, type had different styles for every size, sure in part to the tools of punch cutting, but also to knowledge of the human reader. Many styles were combined within compositions (show examples?)

## Start

- Sketching the idea. Wanting to do many styles in a big monospace family.
- Based this on "casual script," a style of signpainting that I've long been enamored with, and wanted to learn more about

- Prototyping atop Plex mono to test the idea. I also tested another totally different idea (which I still intend to make as a future project), but ultimately went with this weirder one. YOt]mO!

[IMAGE OF FIRST PROTOTYPE]

- Scrapping the prototype, but largely keeping the metrics to stay consistent with other mono fonts. Allows fallbacks during design phase

[IMAGE OF EARLY PROTOTYPE WITH FALLBACKS]

- Early drawings. Searching for something both expressive and simple/typographic. Tried to explore this by making something too wild, and something too rigid. Realized that having a spectrum was more interesting than finding just one thing in the middle. I recieved some excellent feedback from a couple of type designers I look up to especially, and this gave me a boost of ideas to refine the letterforms â€“ making them wild but not _too_ wild, and straightforward but not naÃ¯ve.

## Development at TypeMedia

- Inventing my own casual alphabet, with different brushes and pens. Taking uppercase forms into a roman lowercase.

[SKETCHES]

- Narrowing focus. Experimenting with connected scripts and blackletters, but leaving these aside out of (a small amount) of practicality.

[IMAGES: EARLY EXPLORATIONS OF DIFFERENT STYLES]

- Expanding weight range. The heavy was too good to ignore. Most type designers say that the weight range of monospace designs are limited by what complex characters can do. I disagree. ðŸ˜ˆ "Sporklike" contrast and overall color

[IMAGES: EARLY EXPLORATIONS OF HEAVY STYLES]

- Finding the right balance of personality and typographic harmony
- Making curviness match between letters like /n and /o â€“ finding that low connections and bouncy contrast could help with this

[IMAGES: EARLY /n & /o VERSUS CURRENT /n & /o (maybe a word like `sonorous`?)]

- Made a chrome extension to inject my font into any page, and read with it. (This has since been turned into Type-X, a very useful and much faster version of what I made â€“ thanks, @PixelAmbacht).

[EARLY VERSION OF TYPE-X][current version of type-x]

- Paying attention to text rendering by using the fonts. Smoothing kinks from Linear styles to make them as seemlessly readable as possible â€“ avoiding visual "breaks" or whitespots in letters
- Making a sans by scripting some Glyphs to copy over but leaving others to draw/adjust
- Producing materials for the TypeMedia thesis: specimens, poster, process book, and a simple web type tester

## After TypeMedia

- Further developing the recursive minisite as a way to better understand react/Gatsby and as a better way to show the project to others
- Making my TypeMedia class website
- I started freelancing, primarily at Google Fonts, working on variable font upgrades and onboarding, to upgrade existing fonts like Encode, and onboard new, popular fonts like Fira Code and Inter.
- I established my type design & development company, Arrow Type (named for some of the most useful but most-often forgotten glyphs in type design).
- Discovered a critical issue with Recursive that I had missed TypeMedia by only working on a 4K monitor. I drew Recursive in such a way that took the idea of designing with "The Stroke" in mind very literally, overlapping contours in each letter to mimick the strokes of a brush, painting these letters. This approach enhanced my design approach in some ways and gave me flexibility to think differently about what I was drawing, but it had a major drawback on lower-resolution screens: overlaps showed up as little "blobs" on the outlines of letters, leading text to be subtly distorted in an unflattering way. This was due to each contour getting "antialiased," and these partially-lit pixels overlapping and adding up in value.

## Deciding to release through Google Fonts

- I had been planning to work on Recursive as a side project, and eventually release it either through Arrow Type or through a more establish type foundry. However, because Google Fonts is in the process of pushing their library further into the realm of variable fonts, they offered to sponsor me to finish Recursive and release it sooner, as an OFL (open-source) font.
- In the type industry, Google Fonts is somewhat controversial. Does it devalue the industry to have so many free options? I discussed my options with a few trusted type designers.
- Ultimately, I decided that for Recursive, Google Fonts was an ideal place to release. This typeface is for coders of all abilities and experiences, code documentation, and to push new ideas forward in variable type on the web, software, and end users. It could be a niche product that i made a side project for 5 years, or it could make an impact and be published within 2019. There are still tons of benefits in favor of buying non-open type. Operator and Input are _masterful,_ classic designs. I am not trying to replace them, but rather, to push the wider typographic environment to be more interesting and expressive.

## Improvements made for Google Fonts release

- I knew I needed to remove some overlaps to improve text rendering. To meet Google Fonts standards, I also needed to extend the character set, adding more currency symbols, adding support for Vietnamese, and other such additions. Should I change it more than this?
- One designer's advice: "Don't change it much. Use your new ideas on future projects." Sound advice. I had already sold the font to a client. Why put in more work?
- Another designer asked me: "Do you think you will really have the freedom you want if you publish through Google fonts?"
- Goaded on by the second question, I decided to ignore the advice to take the short road. I set about adding a more cursive italic lowercase, giving many more curves to slanted forms, designing inktraps, removing problematic overlaps, and refining basically everything. And adding code ligatures.
- It was a lot of work to do! Luckily, I was able to get help from some awesome collaborators. Katja, Lisa, and RafaÅ‚.

### Cursive letters

- for a more fun and unique italic. Bringing these from a stylistic set into their own ital axis, for easier control and less font weight than stylistic sets.

### Curvy slanted forms

- for an even wider range of expression. Kept horizontal curves flat, but put curves into all vertical strokes to better follow the movement of a brush.

### Inktraps

â€“ If you look closely at modern type releases, you will see that many of them (or maybe nearly all of them) have _inktraps,_ which are little flattened corners in the whitespace of letters â€“ these are especially common in acute angles such as the joint in an `n` or the vertices in a `W`. Historically, these were added spaces cut into the corners to increase legibility in fonts which would be printed in ink. The ink would tend to spread out from the printing, filling in such corners to make them crisp. In digital fonts, it is debatable whether inktraps really serve much of a purpose of aiding legibility in text sizes. I, for one, find that they are only really noticeable in the contrast they add to joints. This does add some drama at text sizes, but in my eyes, the real benefit of inktraps comes at much larger sizes. Inktraps are a visual hack that tacitly signals, "This typeface is carefully drawn. Every curve and every corner has been considered." In "Graphic Design 101" language, inktraps enhance figure-ground integration by shaping the whitespace in a way that reflects the form of the letters.

- I had already cut the point ends of strokes in an homage to Verdana, so it felt natural to reflect this stroke blunting with similar cuts to inner corners.
- Me, in March: How hard can it be to add inktraps?
- Answer: very hard. Inktraps seem like a small decision, but actually, inktraps are very challenging to do right. How big should they be? How consistent in size? Angle? What about in different Glyphs? Different masters?

### Removing overlaps for better rendering at text sizes

- During TypeMedia, I drew Recursive in such a way that took the idea of designing with "The Stroke" in mind very literally. However, I realized right after TypeMedia that while this approach did enhance my design approach in some ways and gave me flexibility to think differently about what I was drawing, it had a critical flaw in use: overlaps showed up as little "blobs" on the outlines of letters, leading text to be subtly distorted in an unflattering way.

### General Refinements

- Things were drawn quickly at TypeMedia because I needed to cover a lot of ground in just a few months, so tons of things were bothering me. Lumpy curves, asymmetrical glyphs that should be symmetrical, not-quite ideal proportions, almost no kerning in sans beyond a proof of concept.
- RafaÅ‚ helped develop two important tools
  - Master compatibility, to help find and correct incompatible glyph drawings
  - Glyph Mirror, to make it much faster to draw symmetrica contours where desired

### Code ligatures

- Code ligatures are controversial among type designers. Typographically, they have several easy-to-identify problems. Most notably, they make code harder for the uninitiated to read. How do you know what syntax you're looking at if the characters in that syntax have changed? For example, `<=` is technically two separate unicode symbols, and even though it means "less than or equal to" in several coding languages, it is certainly different, unicode-wise, than the character `â‰¤`.
- However, in [a (somewhat non-scientific) Twitter poll](https://twitter.com/ThunderNixon/status/1108416704961499143), 21% of 780+ respondents said they "won't code without 'em." Some of the people who said this are coders I really look up to, so I couldn't just dismiss them off-hand.
- Why are they useful? They are like syntax highlighting. They help coders to see that they have typed the right thing in the moment, and to visually scan their code more easily later on
- Worked with RafaÅ‚ on early designs of this. Principles: better chunking (things with a combined meaning should be "one unit" even if they don't physically connect, such as `||` or `**`), more recognizability, and improving legibility.
- Crowdfunding this part so RafaÅ‚ and I can finish these. Google will match contributions!
