# Axis subsetting/instantiation tests, April 2020

These tests are relavant to https://github.com/arrowtype/recursive-minisite/issues/33, and have the following goals:

- Test whether a 300–400 font has any different weight than a 300–800 font (in the case of Recursive)
- Determine overall possible filesizes expected from the Google Fonts CSS2 API.
