# Test for hover transition with `font-style: oblique XXdeg`

Currently, this hover transition only works when tested in Firefox Nightly.

However, because it goes from one numerical value to another, it should be possible to smoothly transition between states in any browser.

Relevant to https://github.com/arrowtype/recursive/pull/330.
