"""
  This is a set of Python I use many times I wish to make an animation or multipage doc with Drawbot, 
  but code in my preferred editor (currently, VS Code) rather than in the Drawbot app.

  USAGE:

  First, install DrawBot as a module:

  pip install git+https://github.com/typemytype/drawbot
  
  Adapt script as needed, then run from the command line with:
  
  python3 <path>/remote-drawbot-script-template.py
"""

from drawBot import * # requires drawbot to be installed as module
import sys
import os
import re

newDrawing() # required by drawbot module

# currentDir = sys.argv[0]
currentDir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
print(currentDir)
