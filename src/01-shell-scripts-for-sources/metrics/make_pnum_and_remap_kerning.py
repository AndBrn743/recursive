"""
    Goals:
    - Make set of .pnum figures
    - Map kerning currently used for default figures to the pnum
    - Remove kerning from default figures

    Maybe....?
    1. Change names of default figures (add .pnum suffixes in a way that updates groups & kerning)
    2. Duplicate new pnum figures as default figures
    3. Restore unicodes to default figures

    No, thatâ€™s too complicated in practice. Instead:
    1. Duplicate the figures as component glyphs with .pnum suffix (skip /one, because /one.sans exists)
    2. Update all references in kerning, adding .pnum suffix to any number names
    3. Remove kerning references to /one (there are several)

    # TODO: also make one.sans_tnum, with:
